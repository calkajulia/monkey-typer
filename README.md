# monkey typer

A fast-paced typing game built with C++ and SFML where words scroll across the screen and you must type them before they reach the edge.

## How to Play

1. Configure your settings: word count (20/40/80), speed (0.02/0.04/0.06), and text size (20/30/40)
2. Words appear from the left side of the screen moving right
3. Type each word exactly as it appears before it reaches the right edge
4. Words change color as they get closer to the edge (yellow = warning, red = danger)
5. **Goal:** Type all words correctly to win the game
